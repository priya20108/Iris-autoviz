# Iris-autoviz

Exploratory Data Analysis on Irisdata using autoviz

Background Information :

This is perhaps the best known database to be found in the pattern recognition literature. Fisher's paper is a classic in the field and is referenced frequently to this day. (See Duda & Hart, for example.) The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant. One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the latter are NOT linearly separable from each other.

Predicted attribute: class of iris plant.

This is an exceedingly simple domain.

Solutions :
This dataset gives the information about the iris plant. This dataset is used nunber of times to perform and study various mashine learning algorithms. We have tried visualizing this dataset using auto-visualization library called "autoviz".   

Dataset :
In this EDA (exploratory data analysis i will be using a bank dataset's that consist of 100000 users from, France, Spain, Germany and includes the following variable :

Problem Statement
While the average rate of churn experienced little change, some sectors saw significant increases. The highest churn rate increase of 102% was in the banking sector, which saw the number of customers switching more than double from 12.2% to 24.6%.

Customer Churn

EDA Goals
Finding out types of customers that most likely to churn
Finding out country that has the highest numbers of churn customers
Finding out does Credit Score and churn in banking has a correlation
