# Iris-autoviz

Exploratory Data Analysis on Irisdata using autoviz

Background Information :

This is perhaps the best known database to be found in the pattern recognition literature. Fisher's paper is a classic in the field and is referenced frequently to this day. (See Duda & Hart, for example.) The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant. One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the latter are NOT linearly separable from each other.

Predicted attribute: class of iris plant.

This is an exceedingly simple domain.

Solutions :
This dataset gives the information about the iris plant. This dataset is used nunber of times to perform and study various mashine learning algorithms. We have tried visualizing this dataset using auto-visualization library called "autoviz".   

Dataset :
In this EDA (exploratory data analysis), I will be using Iris dataset and autoviz library to understand the features of the dataset:
